        As I walked into TJ Maxx, I noticed a dog at the entrance, wagging his tail like he was ready to burst with excitement. When I got closer, he jumped up on me, paws on my hips, and greeted me with the sweetest smile. I couldnâ€™t help but laugh and kneel down to pet him. In that moment, all my worries just faded away. It felt like this friendly dog knew I needed a little boost, and he made me feel so special.
        While I scratched behind his ears, I realized how such a simple greeting could turn my day around. Other shoppers smiled at us, and it felt like we were all sharing this little moment of joy.
        When I finally stood up to keep shopping, I felt lighter and happier especially cause I got the perfect shot. That dog reminded me how a little kindness can really brighten your day, even in a busy store. It showed me that you can always find moments to connect with others.
